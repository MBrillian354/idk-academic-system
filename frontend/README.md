## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
The page will reload on changes and display lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.


### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.


### `npm run eject`
Removes the single build dependency from your project and copies configuration files and dependencies for full control. **Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
